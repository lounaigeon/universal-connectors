SCRs can be seen and used by authorised staff in other areas of the health and care system involved in the patient's direct care.\n\nThis API is currently only approved for use in primary care software, specifically GP software. We hope to make it available for secondary care in the future. You can vote for this on our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/suggestions/151217/summary-care-record-scr-fhir-api-other-use-cases).\n\nAlso use this API to update a patient's SCR Consent Preference on the Spine ACS and to raise electronic Alerts when:\n* a SCR is accessed without the patient's permission\nand/or\n* the equivalent of Self-Claim Legitimate Relationship is created by an individual, who subsequently accesses the patient's SCR\n* send an SCR alert message, on those occasions when an SCR is accessed without the patient's permission e.g., in an emergency or when the equivalent of Self-Claim Legitimate Relationship is created.\n* update a patient's SCR Consent Preference on the Spine ACS\n\nYou can:\n* get a patient's SCR identifier\n* get a patient's SCR\n* upload a patient's SCR\n* send a privacy alert message, if you have to override a patient's dissent to view their SCR \n* update a patient's SCR Consent Preference on the Spine ACS\n\nA health or care staff providing direct care to patients must be present and authenticated with an [NHS smartcard or a modern alternative](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) to use this API.\n\n## Who can use this API\nThis API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development. You must do this before you can go live (see â€˜Onboarding' below).\n\nThis API is initially for use by new market entrant GP IT developers with other use cases to follow later.\n\n## Related APIs\nTo use this API, you need the patient's NHS number, which can be retrieved by using the following API:\n  - [Personal Demographics Service (FHIR) API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir) - use this API to search for patients and retrieve their details.  This API can also be used to update their details in some cases. This is the latest version of the PDS API and is recommended for all new integrators.\n\nThis API has endpoints enabling you to get and set access permissions, the same as the [Access Control Service (ACS) HL7 V3 API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/access-control-service-hl7-v3) which it partly replaces.\n\n## API status and roadmap\nThis API is initially for use by new market entrant GP IT developers with other use cases to follow later.\n\nThis API is [in production, beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning:\n\n- the API is available in our sandbox and integration test environments\n- the API is available for production (private beta) use\n- we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we'll give advance notice\n\nTo see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?order=popular&filter=all&tag=scr-fhir-api&deleted=0#controls).\n\nIf you have any other queries, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).\n\n## Technology\nThis API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).\n\nIt conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.\n\nIt includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which are built against [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), specifically [UK.core.r4.v2 2.0.5](https://simplifier.net/packages/uk.core.r4.v2/2.0.5).\n\n## Network access\nThis API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network). To use this API with [NHS smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers), the end user needs an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives to smartcards are available.\n\nFor more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).\n\n## Security and authorisation\nThis API has two authorisation methods. The first is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis), meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.\n\nThe end user must be:\n- a health or care staff providing direct care to patients\n- strongly authenticated, using either an [NHS smartcard or a modern alternative](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) available via [NHS Care Identity Service 2 (NHS CIS2)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-identity)\n\nThe API uses OAuth 2.0 to authorise the calling system. It supports the following security patterns:\n\n- [user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS CIS2 - combined authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-combined-authentication-and-authorisation)\n- [user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS CIS2 - separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-separate-authentication-and-authorisation)\n\nFor more details, see [user-restricted APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis).\n\nThe second authorisation method is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis) (signed JWT authentication), meaning a few specific API calls can be authorised by the application making the requests. This is typically provided so that GPs can perform batch updates of multiple Summary Care Records through the SCR Application (SCRa).\n\nThe following specific endpoint and method combinations can be used with application-restricted authentication, in addition to user-restricted authentication:\n\n- GET DocumentReference\n- GET Bundle\n- POST Bundle\n\nFor more details, see:\n- [application-restricted APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis) and \n- [application-restricted RESTful APIs - signed with JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)\n\n## Environments and testing\n| Purpose                                | Base URL                                            |\n| ---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Sandbox                                | `https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/summary-care-record/FHIR/R4`|\n| Integration test                       | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/summary-care-record/FHIR/R4`    |\n| Production                             | `https://api.service.nhs.uk/summary-care-record/FHIR/R4`    |\n\n## NME Testing\nThe approach to testing for external developers is as follows.\n\nFor sandbox, New Market Entrants (NMEs) should perform Self Testing, followed by Integration Testing which will be available on the Assurance Technical Evidencing. NMEs need to meet these to progress in integration.\n\n### Sandbox testing\nOur [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):\n  - is for early developer testing\n  - only covers a limited set of scenarios\n  - is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates\n  - is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation\n\n  For more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our \\\"Try this API\\\" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.\n\n### Integration testing\nOur [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):\n\n* is for formal integration testing\n* is stateful, so persists updates\n* includes authorisation, with [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) and non-smartcard options\n\nIt also includes ready-to-use [summary care record test data](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/summary-care-record-fhir/summary-care-record-fhir-api-test-data).\n\nFor more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).   \n\n### Production\nOur [production environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/path-to-live-environments):\n\n* is for formal use in a live environment\n* is stateful, so persists updates\n* includes authorisation, with [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers)\n\nFor more information about our Production Environment, contact the [National Service Desk](ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.net)\n\n## Onboarding\nYou need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it's worth planning well ahead.\n\nAs part of this process, you need to demonstrate that you can manage risks and that your software conforms technically with the requirements for this API.\n\nInformation on this page might impact the design of your software. For details, see [Onboarding support information](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/summary-care-record-fhir/onboarding-support-information).\n\nTo understand how our online digital onboarding process works, see [digital onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/digital-onboarding).\n\n<div class=\"nhsd-m-emphasis-box nhsd-m-emphasis-box--emphasis nhsd-!t-margin-bottom-6\" aria-label=\"Highlighted Information\">\n    <div class=\"nhsd-a-box nhsd-a-box--border-blue\">\n        <div class=\"nhsd-m-emphasis-box__image-box\">\n            <figure class=\"nhsd-a-image\">\n                <picture class=\"nhsd-a-image__picture\">\n                    <img src=\"http://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/icons/play-circle.svg?colour=231f20\" alt=\"\" style=\"object-fit:fill\">\n                </picture>\n            </figure>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"nhsd-m-emphasis-box__content-box\">\n            <div data-uipath=\"website.contentblock.emphasis.content\" class=\"nhsd-t-word-break\"><p class=\"nhsd-t-body\">To get started, sign in or create a <a href=\"http://onboarding.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/\">developer account</a>, then select 'product onboarding'.</p></div>            \n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n* After setting up your new application through the NHS Developer Portal and connecting it to the Summary Care Record API, you will need to ensure your application has a valid ASID custom attribute. ITOC support services should be able to ensure your ASID values are setup to use the [QUPC_IN190000UK04](https://data.developer.nhs.uk/dms/mim/4.2.00/Domains/PSIS%20Query/Document%20files/PSIS%20Query%20IM.htm#_Toc_Section_6.2) interaction. This interaction is for access to resources on Personal Spine Information Service (PSIS), the former name of Summary Care Record. If this isn't setup, you may encounter 403 Forbidden errors when accessing records. This can be checked by emailing [itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net](mailto:itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net).\n* ITOC should also be able to apply the GP summary v3 message set to the endpoints for you.\n\n## Errors\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n\n* 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action\n* 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application\n* 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server\n\nErrors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.\n\n## Exponential Backoff\nIn the event of a transitory error:\n\n* 429 â€“ exceeded application rate limit (5 TPS per application)\n* 500 â€“ internal server error\n* 503 â€“ service unavailable\n* 504 â€“ response timed out\n\nThe following retries are recommended:\n\n* Attempt 1: 1 minute after first failure\n* Attempt 2: 30 minutes after attempt 1\n* Attempt 3: 60 minutes after attempt 2\n* Attempt 4: 2 hours after attempt 3\n* Attempt 5: 4 hours after attempt 4\n* Attempt 6: 8 hours after attempt 5\n* Attempt 7: 16 hours after attempt 6\n* If attempt 7 fails, then fail permanently.\n\n## Operations\nHere are the links to the possible SCR operations.
